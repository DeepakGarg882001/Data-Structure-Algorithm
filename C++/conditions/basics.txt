Q. Difference between variable and constant.
Sol: A Data Type will be called as Variable when we allow to change its value further in future, i.e value  is Varying.
     A Data Type will be called as Constant when we don't allow to change its value in future, i,e value is constant.



 Q. Difference between break and continue ?
 sol:  
     Note: Generally we use `break` and `continue` keyword  inside any Loop. So basically these keywords affect the Looping condition and rules directly.

     -> In other words if we are using `break` inside any loop then it will stop executing that loop after that keyword and pointer will start executing next line ,next after from where the whole entire loop is ending.


      Break 
      -> break is used , when a Any condition reach at desire Level , then stop that looping condition at that point and spike all the remaining code and condition below that break keyword.

      -> break keyword points the pointer at the bottom of that Loop, i.e at the last of curly braces { }. 
        eg. 
             for(){                      
                 if(1){}                 

                 if(2){}

                 if(3){ break;}

                 if(4){}

                 if(5){}
             }    

             so from above example, when the pointer will reach at if(3) then it will found a break condition and stop executing this loop and point to the last curly braces } 



        continue:
        -> continue also behave like break keyword i.e if we use this then all the remaining code in the loop will not execute , but have a major difference that continue keyword points the Pointer at the starting of loop. so that loop start from the Top to check the condition again and then execute the loop.
