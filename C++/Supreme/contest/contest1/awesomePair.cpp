// Geek is busy solving problems on Bitwise operators. Today while solving problems, he observed something which intrigued him very much. He discovered that there are some awesome pairs in a list of integers whose Bitwise AND is strictly greater than Bitwise XOR among them.
// Given a list arr[] of N integers find the number of awesome pairs.


// Example 1:

// Input:
// N = 4
// arr[] = {6, 2, 5, 3}
// Output: 2
// Explanation: 
// Awesome pairs are (6, 5) and (2, 3).

// Example 2:

// Input:
// N = 3
// arr[] = {1, 1, 1}
// Output: 3
// Explanation: All pairs are awesome.

// Your Task:  
// You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function pairs() that takes the array arr[] and its size N as input parameters and return the number of awesome pairs.


// Constraints:
// 1 <= N <= 106
// 0 <= arr[i] <= 109


// Runtime Error 
// Your Output:
// Time Limit Exceeded


// Your program took more time than expected.Time Limit Exceeded
// Expected Time Limit 1.23sec
