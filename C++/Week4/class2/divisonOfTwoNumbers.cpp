// Given two integers one is a dividend and the other is the divisor, we need to find the quotient when the dividend is divided by the divisor without the use of any ” / “ and ” % “ operators. 

// Examples:

// Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 2
// Output: 5
// Explanation: 10/2 = 5.

// Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 10/3 = 3.33333… which is truncated to 3.
